# Kickstarter Campaign 

I would like to use the idea that as a burlesque dancer I could have a Kickstarter to fund a documentary on 
the process behind the creation of an act. Little do people know the time, effort, and money that goes in to what they
see on stage. The inspiration behind an act varies so much and even the amount of time varies as well. I am independent
performer but I could get plenty of other performers who would be interested in detailing their act progression. The 
documentary could start with performances and then cut to us in our homes without the glamor, lights, and crowd energy. 
We could talk about how we got into burlesque, list our act repertoire, talk about an act or acts that we gave every 
fiber of our being too, the list goes on. From there we can talk about how an act goes from an idea to performed on stage.
The more involved the more money that could be raised. Simply posting on Facebook could garner funds pretty quickly.
Rewards could be based on the amount of momey given by donors. Up to $50 donors could get a personalized
thank you card. Up to $200 could be
a t-shirt with the title logo and thank you card. Up to $500 could be thank you card, a photo, t-shirt, and a copy of the DVD.
